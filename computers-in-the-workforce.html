          <p>
            The use of computers in the workforce has always been controversial. Some argue efficiency while some argue the amount of jobs that are lost is far too much. (However, computers have opened up other industries too). The amount of people losing their jobs would mean an increase in poverty, and hungry families struggling to survive,
            especially in the cold winter nights. However efficiency can help improve the world and deliver results as fast as possible. This is why computers are not as bad people think.

            <p>
          The use of computers at work can be seen worldwide in all sorts of environments. While computers are mainly used in the office, many jobs depend on it. Examples include software development, technicians etc. However many jobs have been replaced completely or are in the process of being
          replaced, such as taxi operators (bookings and calls are nowadays done online), phone operators (where automated voices are now being much more common to tackle problems), cashiers (where self-checkouts are found everywhere) etc.

                    <li><b>Speed:</b> computers are faster than humans and this is a fact. Computers can complete jobs in seconds which would otherwise take humans hours or days.</li>
                    <li><b>Efficiency:</b> from an employers point of view, buying computers are a good investment as computers can help complete jobs faster, and less humans may need to be employed and wages paid, therefore increasing profit for a company in the long term.</li>
                    <li>
                    <b>Accuracy:</b> computers in general can have 100% accuracy when programmed correctly, and this can be vital such as in an emergency such as nuclear power plant failures. Humans are prone to mistakes, possibly costing injuries or even deaths. Mistakes must also be resolved which can be
                    expensive.
