            Computers and the use of technology, likewise electricity has slowly destroyed the environment, making global warming worse. However the use of A.I and robots has made it possible to be able to clean up the environment at a large scale, in an efficient manner.
             Making technology much more efficient will help to slow down the effect of global warming, and reduce the amount of wasted energy in the future.

              Renewables sources come from advancements in technology and research for these come from working at a computer. Robots are used to clean up plastic and other waste from beaches, while there are drones designed to plant trees, improving the environment.

                    <li><b>Email/Messaging:</b> using these software is better than printing paper, and then delivering to the recipient, who may be far away, to the extent, planes or cars are needed to transport these letters (these transport methods may emit harmful gases and damage the environment further).</li>
                    <li><b>Video Chat:</b> by calling with phones or having video conferences, it will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases by reducing the amount of transport that people would have used to travel to meetings etc. Furthermore, it is easier to connect to anyone who has Internet access.</li>

                    <li><b>E-Waste:</b> this can cause poisonous chemicals to be released from this waste into the environment, polluting rivers, land etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Production:</b> the production of computers and the manufacturing process uses up a lot of energy, as well as release harmful gases to the environment, creating pollution.</li>
