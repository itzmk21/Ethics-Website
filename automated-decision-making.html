          <p>
           Automated decision making means that a computer system will make decisions based on rules or data it is fed. 
           Decision making by computers can be extremely useful in fast paced environments where output is necessary and replied upon as fast as possible, 
           while being 100% accurate too. 
           Automating this can make it easier for humans, and prevent mistakes from happening such as forgetting to do anything.
            Fast environments aren't necessary to take advantage of this type of technology but could simply free up load on anything else manually done.

          Chat bots are used to handle customer service nowadays to reduce the load of humans, and ease customer queues. Timetabling or scheduling is a great way to make use of efficient decision making, as the computer can decide when is the best time for a meeting or if a meeting clashes with another event etc, instead of working it out yourself. Critical ambulance response can be much more faster with a computer deciding which ambulance to send and other details instead of a human, who could mistakenly assign some other.</p>

                    <li><b>Ease:</b> these automated systems can free up time and make it easier for an individual to carry out day to day tasks without much effort into unneccessary scheduling for example.</li>
                    <li><b>Consistency:</b> automated decision making systems will be much more consistent at a task than that of a human</li>

                    <b>Error-free:</b> automating a job can mean less mistakes are likely to happen concerning the job, unlike a human.

                    <li><b>Redundancy:</b>  if the way a job is done changes or any other factor, then the automation itself could be useless and must be reprogrammed.</li>
                    <li><b>Trust:</b> trusting the automated decisions actually make a correct one and trusting it do the actual job may not be a good idea since computers do have their occassions when they can outright fail.</li>

                    <b>Human programming</b> a human must program the system itself first which may be expensive in both time and money.
