          <h1>Censorship & The Internet</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Internet censorship is the control of what can be accessed by people and what cannot. This can be great by censoring adult content or websites where malware is more likely to be on. However countries can censor what useful websites can be accessed, such as Russia blocking the use of the
            BBC website, for their own selfish intents, or from other countries brainwashing their residents. This stops the right information from being spread, and cuts off people from the rest of the world.

          <h1>Monitoring Behaviour</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            People with power can monitor and track what any normal citizen can do, invading their privacy. This can make users uncomfortable and be violated of their ethical rights. Also, it could be used against them in malicious ways, such as any data that could be sold to the dark web. However, the monitoring of behaviour can help prevent illegal activities such as drugs handling, or human
            trafficking.

          <h1>Analysis of Personal Information</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>The Data Protection Act protects any personal information held by someone or a company. One condition that a company can keep personal information is 
            if the amount of data isn't excessive. Personal information could be stolen from outsiders, and used against them such as advertisement targetting etc. Insiders could
            also take the chance to find out more details on someone, and put the victim at risk of privacy invasion and harassment.

          <h1>Piracy & Offensive Communications</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Piracy is common throughout the world, with many websites still operating, streaming movies or shows illegally. This harms the movie industry and cinemas as people could have
            free access to these services, and therefore, the income for these industries will decrease, putting it as risk of financial instability and reduced funding/budget for any 
            future movie. Furthermore, a lot of websites exploit this, and instead of streaming movies, malware and viruses can be spread to users.<br></br>

            Offensive communications include messages that are offensive to someone etc. This could include cyber-bullying or harassment where users behind a screen, bully other people
            over the Internet. Trolling is also widespread across social media platforms where "trolls" do simple things such as spamming a picture in a group chat. Police have the right to intercept
             communications when and if needed. However, not everyone is caught and a lot of the time, victims are left by themselves.

          <h1>User Interface Design Considerations</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The layout of a page, when designing a web page, should not be confusing. It should be clear to the user where to follow, and which links take the user to which page. A web page that has cards 
            aligned from left to right may be translated using a third party app into a right-left reading language, and so the cards would try to be read right to left. Similarly, charts that may show a positive trend, from left to right, may be seen 
            as negative from right to left natives. Colours should chosen appropriately, where text should never be hard to read - there should be sufficient contrast against the background. 
            Specific colours such as the colour red, may be interpretted differently; red is seen as the colour of luck in the chinese world, while danger for the rest. Fonts should be easy to read too - rounded fonts are generally easier to read. Tools can be used to evaluate 
            how accessible a web page is such as Google's Light House Test, which tests all these factors and gives a rating out of 100, and suggested improvements.
