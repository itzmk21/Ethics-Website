           Artifical Intelligence also known as A.I is relatively new. 
           It is when a computer artifically recreates natural intelligence. 
           It tries to reach outcomes based on what it learns (i.e data that it's given) and processes outcomes to eventually execute what it thinks is correct. 
           Many believe A.I will "take over the world" as whatever they can think of isn't directly controlled or programmed. A.I is also thought to replace many jobs, such warehouse workers.

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Self driving cars are possible yet illegal as of now. 
              However, there are systems in cars that make it as close to self-driving as possible but still legal such as lane assist, 
              which uses A.I to observer where a lane is and position the car correctly. 
              In the finance world, A.I can advise users on how to invest their money. 
              Furthermore, robots in places such as Amazon warehouses, 
              use their A.I to work out where a package is and transport it to the right place at the right time within the warehouse. 
              These are all designed to happen without the need of human intervention.

                    <li><b>Reliability:</b> A.I can operate 24/7 without any breakdowns or interruptions. They can free up manual labour and be more efficient at it too.</li>
                    <li><b>Digital Assistance:</b> A.I can help users with things like how to get to the correct department of customer service etc.</li>

                    <b>Save time:</b> A.I can achieve things and do repetitive boring jobs more quickly, and with this, their ability to do so doesn't decrease.

                    <li><b>Lack of control:</b> not being able to control the system because of its use of A.I can lead to outcomes not desired, things that may seem unethical to humans, won't matter for a robot.</li>
                    <li><b>Privacy:</b> the A.I model must be trained before it can be anywhere near accurate. For this data must be fed to it, which may come from sources where it may not be allowed to feed into a computer.</li>
                    <li>
                    <b>Bias:</b> the type of data may contribute to some bias in the decision making of the A.I which makes outcomes not as accurate and fair as a human's intelligence.
